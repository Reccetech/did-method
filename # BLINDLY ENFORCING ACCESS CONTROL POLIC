# BLINDLY ENFORCING ACCESS CONTROL POLICIES ON ENCRYPTED DATA USING ZERO-KNOWLEDGE

##  Introduction

The goal of Tom's thesis was to create an extension to the Glycos (P2P social networking system), that enforces access control rights without leaking data to the network.
This accompliced by the use of zero-knowledge proofs, based upon the ideas of Nasoumzadeh and Joshi (OSNAC) that introduces a way to embed access control definitions into the ontology defition.



## Zero-knowledge

Zero-knowledge proofs can be classified as decribed by the medium article of Yun:

*  Zero-knowledge proof: proof that a certain statement is true, without revealing the secret
*  Zero-knowledge range proof:  proof that a certain value is in a certain range
*  Zero-knowledge constraint system proof: Proof where the secret inputs are constrained, without revealing the secret inputs. Where the constraint system is the form of F(x1,x2,x3,...)=0

Tom's thesis is based upon implementing the latter clasification where the
